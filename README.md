# 🎉 Tainan 300 Web App

🚀 **Bringing Tainan's 300th Anniversary to Life with Digital Innovation!**

## 📌 About the Project
We are a team of three passionate digital geeks collaborating to create a web application for **Tainan 300**, an exciting anniversary event happening in May 2025! Our goal is to support a local organization by leveraging **LINE Messaging API** to provide a seamless and interactive experience for tourists visiting historical landmarks.

## 🎯 Key Features
- 🏛️ **QR Code Check-ins**: Tourists scan QR codes at designated landmarks to receive a unique passcode.
- 💬 **LINE Integration**: Users receive their passcodes directly via the organization's **LINE Official Account**.
- 🎟️ **Point & Coupon Collection**: Passcodes can be used to redeem **points and exclusive coupons** within the LINE app.
- 🌍 **Enhancing Cultural Engagement**: Encouraging visitors to explore and interact with Tainan's rich history through a gamified experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter Web
- **Backend**: Firebase (Cloud Functions, Firestore, Storage)
- **API**: LINE Messaging API
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare

## 📅 Timeline
